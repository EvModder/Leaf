# Spaces are fine to use, but please realize that 
# they will be counted as a part of a word.
#
# To set a custom replacement (sub) for a bad word, simply use
# '='
# For example, to have "hell" replaced with "nether", write it
# like this:
# thisisabadword,hell=nether,ass=donkey,f***=meep,a@@,etc..
#
# If you want to allow a word on the 'Default blocked list',
# Then put it in like this: hell=hell,crap=crap,
# What this does is simply "replace" the badword with itself
# (Note that you can also open/unzip the .jar file and directly
# edit the default list there)
