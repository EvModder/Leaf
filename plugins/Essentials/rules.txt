&21&f)&7 Don't disruptively lag or crash the server*
&22&f)&7 No doxing of anyone's personal info
&23&f)&7 Be honest in reports
&24&f)&7 No external retribution/blackmail as a means of coercion*
&25&f)&7 Follow Discord community guidelines (&b&ndiscord.com/guidelines&7)



&6Elaboration &f(&21&f, &24&f):
&21&f)&7 &oDisruptively&7 means any online player is NOT ok with the lag. Crashing is only permitted with permission from an online admin.

&24&f)&7 Threatening retribution isnâ€™t allowed based on anything external to the server; e.g., forcing a player to behave a certain way in-game based on outisde pressure.
&7Although we can't enforce it, we also discourage the reverse: forcing people to behave a certain way &ooutside&7 the server based on blackmail/threats &oon&7 the server.
